                    <p>Just like the adventurous Dora, I also love to explore challenging things and use data analysis to gain insights into the meaning behind the data. I am a data scientist. I build predictive models and craft stories through visualizations. I love taking on the Viz challenges and sharing stories with analytical perspective with others. Helping business grow through collaboration will make me feel fulfilled. <br><br>
		       While I'm not coding, I like fitness, climbing, games, art and experience new things. I like visiting museums and exhibitions. On a random weekend, you might meet me in Chelsea's gallery or find me riding a citi bike in Central Park.</p>

                                Hate crime and Homelessness are two topics that lot of people concern about in USA. However, it is still difficult to regulate with policies and laws that are existed now.
				For hate crime, the government needs more efficient and comprehensive methods to track the crime data. This study is expected to use past hate crime and homeless data to predict the future crime incident.
				Studying this issue can contribute to reducing homelessness and crime rate, improving social status and city appearance.   <br><br>

                                <b>BIG PICTURE</b><br>
                                We use python to clean, merge two data sets including homelessness and hate crime with 140k+ disorder data for up to 12 years. Then, we determine the variables to make assumptions, create 20 Tableau charts according to hypothesis for visual analysis for analysis. Such as Homelessness, crime rate, victim, offender, location, researching the relationship between each other to make further predictions about the next hate crime. 
				Finally, display correlation and Random forest model with SPSS to test hypothesis. <br>
				 
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Hypothesis</b><br>
				Here is our Hypothesis:<br><br>
				 <img src="img/Homelesshypo.png" class="model-text" width="100%" height="auto"  alt="Homeless and Hate Crime Incident">
				<br>
                                We set up three hypotheses, studied the number, location, and motivation of homelessness and crime, and determined 10 main variables, and then told the story from the visualization chart and reached the conclusion.
				<br><br>
				<b>PHASE ONE: Visualization Results </b><br>
				
				Below we mainly show the results of the Tableau visualization chart. <br>
				<br>
				     <b> Figure 1. U.S. Map of 12-Year Average Hate Crime Incidents and Homelessness (2007-2018) </b><br><br>
				<br><br>
				<img src="img/Homeless1.png" class="model-text" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Homeless and Hate Crime Incident">
				
				The chart shows the 12-year average number of hate crime incidents and homelessness on the U.S. map for each State. The chart insight is that the higher the number of homeless, the highest the number of hate crime incidents and hate crime victims. In the West and the Northeast are the hotspot of homelessness and hate crime incidents as well. The chart implies there is approximately positive correlation between number of homelessness and number of hate crime.<br>
				<br>
				    <b> Figure 2. Area Chart of Monthly Incidents Patterns by Location (2008-2012)</b><br><br>
				<br><br>
				<img src="img/Homeless2.png" class="model-text"  width="100%" height="auto" alt="Homeless and Hate Crime Incident">
				The chart shows the monthly accumulated number of hate crime incidents and offenders by incident location from 2008 to 2012, drilled down by region. The chart insight is to demonstrate the monthly trend of hate crime incidents in the top 5 incident locations with the highest number of crimes committed.  The chart implies that deserted area such as highway, street field and lake as well as resident home has the highest number of hate crime, especially during Summer. Northeast has the highest “unknown” incidents location.<br>
				<br>
				    <b> Figure 3. Sankey Chart of The Victim Flow From Bias Motivation to Offender Profile </b><br><br>
				<br><br>
				<img src="img/Homeless3.png" class="model-text"  width="100%" height="auto" alt="Homeless and Hate Crime Incident">
				The chart shows the percentage of victims by bias motivation and offender races and the flow of victims from bias motivation to offender races. The chart insight is the connection of bias motivation and offender races in order to identify  the kinds of offenders that committed certain crime. The chart implies that the number of racism victims is the highest in the U.S. and white offenders, taking up to 41% of other offender races, plays a major part in hurting these people. Also, the racism victims are mostly attacked by white offenders or unknown offenders.  <br>

The chart insight was to understand which factor can predict if the hate crime incident was single or multiple bias. The most important factor was Total offender and second was incident location. The chart implied that the top incident location was at high-way or bus terminal, which was very deserted places with less people. On the other hand, school at elementary and secondary can be another place for hate crime incidents to happen. <br>

                                <b>Conclusion</b><br>
                                Number of homeless and hate crime are positively correlated according to states. Highways and Home/Residence are the major places where these hate crimes take place and see increase of incidence during summer in all the regions. Majority of victims face race-based crimes. And mostly offenders are white and of unknown race. Anti Black  or African Americans are the major type of crime with the highest number offenders  whereas Anti  Jewish victims are three times more than the offenders.Destruction of property  and intimidation are the  major offences committed which amounts to more than 50% of all  the hate crime offences committed in the country.<br><br>

                                <b>Implications & Recommendation</b><br>
                                Understand the relationship between homelessness and hate crime. Investigate the relationship of hate crime victimization, such as location, time, motivation bias and offender profile to help government  predict the next possible incidents. <br><br>
				77,941 reported cases about hate-crime provided by the FBI & Homelessness data of 49 States of the United States (Nebraska is excluded) provided by US Department of Housing and Urban Development. Limited on homelessness data which is only on the State level and Year level. The reason for unknown offences and why they have not been reported and reasons behind the same.<br><br> 
			        
                             
                                <b>Implications & Recommendation</b><br>
                                [1] It can be implied that hate crimes are more prevalent in states with higher number of homelessness, so government need to be more careful in those areas, specifically in West and Northeast Region.<br>
				[2] Hate crimes in school see a spike as soon as the school starts, therefore schools need a policy  framework which  can improve understanding between people from different races. For Example: Organizing cultural meetups before school starts.<br>
				[3] As property destruction is more prominent in religious places. There should be better  security  measures incorporated during events to avoid these incidents.<br>

				 Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease. The most common medications used for its treatment are β2-agonists and glucocorticosteroids, and one of the primary tissues that these drugs target in the treatment of asthma is the airway smooth muscle. RNA-Seq is used to characterize the human airway smooth muscle (HASM) transcriptome at baseline and under three asthma treatment conditions.
				 Methods: The Illumina TruSeq assay was used to prepare 75bp paired-end libraries for HASM cells from four white male donors under four treatment conditions: 1) no treatment; 2) treatment with a β2-agonist (i.e. Albuterol, 1μM for 18h); 3) treatment with a glucocorticosteroid (i.e. Dexamethasone (Dex), 1μM for 18h); 4) simultaneous treatment with a β2-agonist and glucocorticoid, and the libraries were sequenced with an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 instrument. The Tuxedo Suite Tools were used to align reads to the hg19 reference genome, assemble transcripts, and perform differential expression analysis

				<b>ABOUT THE DATA</b><br>
				Number:8x38694=309552, Tool: R studio, we set treated with dexamethasone versus which samples are untreated controls. <br><br>

                                <b>APPROACH</b><br>
				    <img src="img/RNA2.png" width="100%" height="auto" class="model-text" alt="RNAdata">
				    This research will work with the airway dataset. This data set comes from an RNA-Seq experiment, a high throughput sequencing method, on four human airway smooth muscle cell lines treated and untreated with dexamethasone. The data set has four control groups up to 38,695 rows. <br><br>
				    I have adopted 1) T test and Linear Regression, 2) Differential Expression Analysis and 3) enrichment analysis. In this case we choose variables cell and dex because we care about the cell line and which samples are treated with dexamethasone versus which samples are untreated controls. The basis for this type of analysis is common when analyzing high-throughput data. It has the following steps: Extract the expression values for a single gene. Run compare the mean expression between two groups using a statistical test. Repeat former steps for every gene. Then, from dplyr package to filter out results based on padj < 0.01. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), is a method to identify classes of genes that are over-represented in a large set of genes. 

				
                                <br><br>
				<b>Discussion</b><br>
				<b>1. Visualization results</b><br>
				     <img src="img/RNA3.png" width="100%" height="auto" class="model-text" alt="RNAdata">
				     <img src="img/RNA4.png" width="100%" height="auto" class="model-text" alt="RNAdata">
				First, I converted the data into a matrix and performed Ttest to see if the effect of medication in the treatment was significant. As shown in Figure 1, a single gene is extracted to establish a linear regression. Because it is a simple linear relationship, the linear regression here is also equivalent to the Ttest result. The t-test is a common choice for performing a differential analysis. Next we will perform a simple differential test comparing treated and control groups in our gene expression data. The "dex" column in `metadata` gives group values for treated and control samples . I created a new data.frame called `genedata` with two columns: 1) log-transformed expression values of "ENSG00000002549" and 2) group values from the "dex" variable. Call the columns "ex" and "group", respectively .<br>
				<br>
				Hypothesis H0: Dexamethasone is not related to gene expression, H1: Dexamethasone is related to gene expression. According to Figure 1 and Figure 2, the pvalue of this gene is as high as 0.9981. Although the variable is significant, the Pvalue in Ttest is much greater than 0.05, so accept the null hypothesis that dex has nothing to do with gene expression. After performing the T test on all genes, select the mean difference and Pvalue value for comparison.<br><br>
				    <img src="img/RNAttestall.png" width="100%" height="auto" class="model-text" alt="RNAdata">
				Looking at all the Ttest results, most of the Pvalue are far greater than 0.05. Next we have to do Differential Expression Analysis using DESeq2.
				<br><br>
				<b>2. differential expression analysis </b><br>

				     <img src="img/RNA6.png" width="100%" height="auto" class="model-text" alt="RNAdata">
				<br>
				Now, I will use DESeq2 package for differential expression analysis of the airway data set to find differentially expressed genes between untreated and treated samples. I first loaded DESeq2 and set up the data to be compatible with DESeq by using the function DESeqDataSet(). The function DESeqDataSet includes an argument called design which asks for a formula that expresses how the counts for each gene depends on the variables in colData. In this case I choosed variables cell and dex because care about the cell line and which samples are treated with dexamethasone versus which samples are untreated controls. I set control group reference level for comparison in our differential expression analysis. I run the differential expression analysis steps through the function DESeq(). I generated a results table with log2 fold changes, p values and adjusted p values for each gene. The log2 fold change and the Wald test p value is based on the last variable in the design formula, in this case variable dex. Afterward, I added a column showing whether the significance is TRUE or FALSE based on cutoff padj < 0.01. Then, I used the filter() function from dplyr to filter out results based on padj < 0.01, and write this to a csv file using write_csv() function from readr. Therefore results will show which genes are differentially expressed.<br>
				<br>
				In DESeq2, the function ggplot2 generates a Volcano Plot commonly used to visualize the differential expression results. The plot shows the log2 fold changes attributable to a given variable over the mean of normalized counts for all the samples in the DESeqDataSet. Points represent genes and will be colored red if the adjusted p value is less than 0.1. Points which fall out of the figure5 are plotted as open triangles pointing either up or down. Volcano map can conveniently and intuitively display the distribution of gene differential expression between two samples. Usually the abscissa is expressed by log2 (fold change), the genes with the greater difference are distributed at both ends, the ordinate is represented by -log10 (pvalue), and the negative logarithm of the P value of the T test significance. Generally, the larger the difference multiple is, the more significant the gene T test is, so the values in the upper left corner and the upper right corner are often concerned.    
				<br><br>
				<b>3. Gene set enrichment analysis </b><br>
				    <img src="img/RNA7.png" width="100%" height="auto" class="model-text" alt="RNAdata">
				 Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a method to identify classes of genes that are over-represented in a large set of genes. This is performed by comparing the input gene set with annotated gene sets from online functional databases such as Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG. This is a common step in bioinformatics as it aids with the biological interpretation of results. Keeping only the set of genes that showed statistically-significant change in expression between conditions. Our threshold is be a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1 (i.e. no more than 10% chance that the observed change in expression is due to chance). Not all the genes in the results from DESeq2 were assigned p-values so I filtered out the genes without p-values followed by storing the significant genes separately.<br><br>
				    <img src="img/RNA8.png" width="100%" height="auto" class="model-text" alt="RNAdata">
				 I found the list of all available databases from package and set up list with databases of interest, shown in above. I used the Gene Ontology (GO) databases: GO Biological Process, GO Molecular Function, and GO Cellular Component.<br>
				    <img src="img/RNA9.png" width="100%" height="auto" class="model-text" alt="RNAdata">
				 The genes in this dataset use Ensembl indentifiers, while enrichR expects gene symbols. We'll use the biomaRt package to map our Ensembl IDs to gene symbols. Shown in above, No genes can be compared.<br>
				<br><br>
				
				<b>Conclusion</b><br>
				<b>1. Evaluation </b><br>
				The t-test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a t-distribution under the null hypothesis. A t-test is the most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known.Through the T test of a single gene, the difference in mean is very small relative to the variance, hence the large p-value. We accepted H0 that there is no significant relationship between gene and dexamethasone. <br><br>   
				With control experiments and filtering non-significant cells, it is found that the no significant cells are high proportion. <br><br>
				Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a method to identify classes of genes that are over-represented in a large set of genes. After database comparison, there are no similar genes <br>
                                <br><br>
				 
				<b>2. Implications</b><br>
				Using R studio can simplify many programming procedures. <br><br>
				RNA sequencing (RNAseq) uses the capabilities of high-throughput sequencing methods to provide insight into the transcriptome of a cell that helps in detecting the gene expression for a targeted cell. <br><br>
				There is still a lot to explore on the road to genetic analysis. <br><br>

				 Every March, millions of basketball fans, celebrities, data scientists and even presidents tune in to watch and predict the championship of NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament. Excited by all the odds of filling out a perfect bracket, I joined the annual March Data Crunch Madness competition, hosted by Fordham University and Deloitte.  Even though the NCAA cancelled the tournament because of COVID-19 in 2020, I, and other participants still decided to try our hand at modeling the tournament and kept the tradition at Fordham going.   
                                <br><br>
                                 <i>Available on <a href="https://github.com/DoraDeng629/2020-Fordham-Deloitte-March-Data-Crunch-Madness">Github</a>.</i><br><br> 
				<b>BIG PICTURE</b><br>
				 The goal of the competition is to utilize past tournament data (from 2002 to 2019) to build and test predictive models in order to forecast outcomes of the Final Three in the 2020 NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship. We trained 17-year historical NCAA dataset with more than 150 variables before feature selecting, tested models using machine learning algorithms like ANN and Random Forest. These outcomes are computed probabilistically, and the models are evaluated by log loss. Also, if you are not familiar with log loss, just know that the best model has the lowest log loss. 
				 The models we chose were all above 75% accuracy.<br>
				   <img src="img/logloss.png" class="model-text" alt="MarchMadness"><br>
                                <br><br>
				<b>APPROACH</b><br>
				 Coming into this competition, I did some research on similar projects and came up with a general idea of what to do. I found Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine learning algorithm that comes under Supervised Learning techniques. It can be used for Classification as well as for Regression problems, but mainly used for Classification problems. Logistic regression is used to predict the categorical dependent variable with the help of independent variables. The output of Logistic Regression problem can be only between the 0 and 1. Logistic regression can be used where the probabilities between two classes is required. Such as whether it will rain today or not, either 0 or 1, true or false etc. Logistic regression is based on the concept of Maximum Likelihood estimation. According to this estimation, the observed data should be most probable.
				<br><br>
				 Here I set the winning or losing to 1,0 to determine which independent variable is related to winning or losing. we left the 21 variables as our selected features.   
				<br><br>
				
				   <img src="img/LR.png" width=430px" height="360px" class="model-text" alt="MarchMadness"><br><br>
				<b>Data Exploration</b><br>
				 To decide which variables is suitable for prediction, we need to pay attention to two points: Which variables have a significant effect on winning or losing. Whether there is an autocorrelation between the selected variables. Finally, We keep 21 variables.<br>
				 <br>
				 <img src="img/21var.png" width=500px" height="380px" class="model-text" alt="MarchMadness"><br><br>											  
				 Then we see which variable is the most significant<br> 
				 <br>
				 <img src="img/Figure1.png" width=500px" height="380px" class="model-text" alt="MarchMadness"><br><br>	
				 Figure 1 aggregate the total game a team played and how many times it wins. This chart shows that the more times a team participates in a match, the more it wins. 
				 <br>
				 Figure 2 shows that the team seed is a good indicator for the result of game. The team who has larger average team seed is more likely to have a better win rate. 							     
				 <br> 
				<br><br>
				<b>MODEL SELECTION</b><br>
				After selecting the feature, we can build our model to predict the game results.<br><br>
				We are going to use Three models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Because the model is obviously non-linear. We need to use complex models to predict the results.<br>
				We also need to do cross validation to test our model so that we can avoid problems like overfitting. <br><br>

				<b>PREDICTION RESULT</b><br>
				So which teams are the final four and champion? <br>

				<br><br>
				<b>WRAPPING UP</b><br><br>
				I am happy to say that completing this competition has made me a more competent data scientist, especially under the unprecedented situation. I am excited and hopeful that the 2021’s tournament will not be cancelled so I can make some fun bets with my friends using this model.
